#Assignment

Write an automated script using Python that sends a periodic data summary to Slack
(preferred) or to an Email address. You can get a free slack account and establish web-hooks
to post the summary. For this exercise, you can post the monthly trend analysis of the number
of covid deaths from top 3 states. You can be creative and figure out some different
mechanism (other than slack/email) as well - the goal is to send updates to a group of users
about important metrics periodically.

Message received at Slack
